ANALYSIS:
A crowd of adults sits facing forward in a modest room with fluorescent lighting and a projector overhead. Several individuals in the front row hold papers, while others look toward a speaker or focal point at the far end of the room. The atmosphere suggests a formal meeting, lecture, or presentation.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a sound environment with soft ambient hums and distant, rhythmic murmurs of attentive listeners, layered with subtle footstep echoes and the occasional paper rustle, all anchored in a centered, reverberant space with slightly distant vocal clarity.
