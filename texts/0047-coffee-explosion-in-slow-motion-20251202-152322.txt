TITLE: Coffee Explosion in Slow Motion
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251202-152322

ANALYSIS:
A white enamel mug sits on a wooden table as dark liquid violently splashes upward and outward, droplets suspended mid-air. Beside it rests a plate of assorted pastries and a glass jar filled with coffee beans, with a spoon lying nearby. The background is softly blurred wood paneling, emphasizing the chaotic motion of the splash.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a rich, textured audio moment where a thick, viscous liquid erupts with a sharp, resonant splash, followed by rapid, wet droplets pattering and splattering across surfaces, layered with a low, rumbling bass that pulses with the impact, all spatially centered with a subtle ambient warmth from a nearby ceramic object and distant wooden textures.
