TITLE: Silent Sanctuary Amidst Winter Woods
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251127-130244

ANALYSIS:
An aerial view reveals a small, roofed structure adjacent to a circular, gravel-lined pit, both set within a grassy clearing bordered by leafless trees. A winding path connects the two elements, suggesting a ritual or ceremonial space. The muted earth tones and absence of human presence evoke quiet solitude.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a meditative, ambient soundscape featuring the soft crunch of gravel underfoot, the distant rustle of winter branches in a breeze, and a low, resonant hum that rises and falls like a heartbeat—spatially placing the listener at the edge of the circle, with the structure’s metallic roof echoing faintly above.
