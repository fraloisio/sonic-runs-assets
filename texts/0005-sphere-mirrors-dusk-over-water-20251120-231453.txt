TITLE: Sphere Mirrors Dusk Over Water
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251120-231453

ANALYSIS:
A reflective glass sphere rests on a dark, textured rock, capturing an inverted, sun-starred view of a pier stretching into calm water. The background pier is softly blurred under golden-hour light, while the sphere’s surface precisely mirrors the sun’s rays and structure with high clarity.

LONG PROMPT:
Ambient coastal twilight—gentle tide lap—crisp glass resonance—warm harmonic hum—distant gull cries—subtle wind whispering across stone—low-frequency ocean swell—soft metallic shimmer—echoing pier supports—sudden sunburst crackle—vibrant high-frequency flare—deep atmospheric reverb—spacey echo layer—muted distant traffic hum—gentle granular grain—ambient warmth—spatial depth—slow rhythmic pulse—sunset’s last golden breath—
