TITLE: Echoes of the Fallen Grove
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251127-130659

ANALYSIS:
A grassy field holds scattered tree stumps and logs, with a line of wooden markers stretching into the distance. Behind them, a dense forest of mixed trees rises under an overcast sky. The ground appears damp, with patches of wet earth and scattered leaves, suggesting recent rain or mist.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a soundscape of soft, wet grass underfoot, distant woodpecker taps, and the gentle sigh of wind through sparse branches, layered with the hollow resonance of hollow logs and a low hum of ambient forest moisture.
