TITLE: Yawning Whisker Symphony
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251124-144446

ANALYSIS:
A small black-and-white kitten is captured mid-yawn, head tilted back, mouth wide open to reveal its pink tongue and tiny teeth. Its whiskers are extended upward, and its ears are perked, suggesting alertness despite the sleepy expression. The background is softly blurred, with warm tones and hints of outdoor light. The kitten’s fur is smooth and predominantly white with a distinct black patch over one eye.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a soft, rhythmic sound that starts with a gentle exhalation, swells into a deep, resonant yawn with subtle tongue scrapes and tooth clicks, then fades into a breathy sigh — all enveloped in a warm, slightly reverberant spatial field with a hint of distant ambient murmur.
