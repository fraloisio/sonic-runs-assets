TITLE: Liquid Echo in Gradient Light
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251126-114616

ANALYSIS:
A water droplet impacts a surface, forming a crown-like splash with droplets suspended mid-air. Ripples expand outward, and a perfect mirror reflection is visible beneath the surface. The background features a smooth gradient from warm yellow to cool teal. The scene captures a moment of high-speed fluid dynamics with sharp clarity.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a crisp, transient acoustic burst with a hollow metallic ring, followed by gentle, decaying water droplet pings and subtle ripple textures, all enveloped in a spatial gradient that shifts from warm to cool tonal depth.
