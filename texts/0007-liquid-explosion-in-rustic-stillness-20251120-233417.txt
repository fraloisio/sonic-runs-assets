TITLE: Liquid Explosion in Rustic Stillness
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251120-233417

ANALYSIS:
A white enamel mug erupts with a vivid splash of amber liquid, droplets suspended mid-air against a warm wooden backdrop. Beside it rests a plate of assorted cookies and a glass jar spilling cocoa beans, all set on a weathered tabletop. The composition suggests motion frozen in time, lit by directional warmth.

LONG PROMPT:
Warm wooden ambience—crisp liquid hiss, creamy splatter pop, soft ceramic clink, granular chocolate crunch, distant muffled jar rattle, airy droplet tinkle, rhythmic spatula scrape, ambient warmth hum—spatially layered with mid-range splash focus, rear cocoa bean rustle, and foreground spoon whisper—texture-rich, tactile, and warmly reverberant.
