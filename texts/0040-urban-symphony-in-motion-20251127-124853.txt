ANALYSIS:
A man sits at a grand piano outdoors, playing amidst pedestrians and a fountain’s spray. Trees frame the scene, and a backpack rests nearby as passersby move through the space. The setting suggests a public park under bright daylight.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a layered soundscape with the warm resonance of piano notes weaving through ambient chatter, distant footsteps, and the rhythmic gurgle of water, all under an open sky with subtle reverb to suggest spaciousness.
