TITLE: Prism of Perception
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251124-173415

ANALYSIS:
A geometric, multi-colored prism dominates a vintage magazine cover, casting intersecting lines toward two stylized trees. The composition is balanced by vertical text on the left and issue details on the right, all on aged, off-white paper. The design evokes mid-century modernist graphic art with clean lines and saturated primary hues.

LONG PROMPT:
Craft a minimalist, spatial sound that begins with a crisp, resonant chime, then layers rhythmic, echoing tones that converge and diverge like light through a prism, fading into a soft, organic rustle as if wind passes through distant foliage.
