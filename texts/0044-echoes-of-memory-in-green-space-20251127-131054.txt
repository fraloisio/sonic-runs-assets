TITLE: Echoes of Memory in Green Space
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251127-131054

ANALYSIS:
A museum exhibit features a mint-green interactive table with photo cards, moss, and a burlap sack. Behind it, a wall displays questions in German and English about a camp’s history, with hanging text panels and a digital screen. The space feels quiet, reflective, and designed for contemplative exploration.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a layered soundscape where soft ambient tones mimic rustling moss and distant whispers, punctuated by subtle clicks and page-turns as if browsing memory cards, all fading into a gentle echo that lingers like unresolved history.
