ANALYSIS:
A colorful market stall displays rows of fresh produce—eggplants, carrots, cherries, bananas, tomatoes, and peppers—in a dense, layered arrangement. Each type is grouped by hue and shape, creating a rich, textured mosaic that feels abundant and freshly harvested.

LONG PROMPT:
Market bustle—bustling, humid, organic—crunch of carrots underfoot—squelch of damp earth—pulsing hum of distant chatter—rustle of plastic bags—sizzle of ripe cherry skins—gush of banana peels—sudden pop of a tomato’s skin—warm breeze stirring greens—low thrum of vendor carts—distant metallic clang—sudden splash of a dropped crate—echoing chatter—hollow thump of a melon—sustained hum of life—warm, layered, living space.
