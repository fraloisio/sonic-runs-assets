TITLE: Yawn of the Silent Predator
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251124-142314

ANALYSIS:
A close-up view captures the moment a cat’s mouth stretches wide, revealing teeth and tongue. The long, thin whiskers fan outward against a dark, out-of-focus backdrop. The focus is entirely on the open jaw and interior of the mouth, with no other context provided.

LONG PROMPT:
Background: A deep, still, and slightly textured silence suggesting an enclosed, quiet space.  
Foreground: A slow, resonant yawn—first a soft inhalation, then a deep, wet opening of the throat, followed by a low-pitched, gurgling release.  
Spatial Qualities: The sound originates from directly in front, intimate and close, with no echo or reverb, implying a small, contained chamber.  
Mood: Sleepy, vulnerable, and primordial—raw, unguarded, and deeply restful.
