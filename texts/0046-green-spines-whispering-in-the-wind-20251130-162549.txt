TITLE: Green Spines Whispering in the Wind
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251130-162549

ANALYSIS:
Dense clusters of bright green cactus stems rise vertically, each adorned with sharp, evenly spaced spines. The stems vary slightly in thickness and angle, creating a textured, repetitive pattern across the frame. Soft depth-of-field blurs the background, emphasizing the tactile, jagged geometry of the foreground stems.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a layered, organic ambient soundscape with rhythmic, high-pitched squeaks mimicking spine rustling, interspersed with distant, low-frequency wind hums—panning gently left and right to evoke a dense, prickly field alive with subtle motion.
