TITLE: Midnight Keys in a Sunlit Square
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251121-234230

ANALYSIS:
A man sits at a grand piano outdoors, his back to the camera, as people stroll past in a park. A fountain’s mist rises behind him, partially obscuring trees and lampposts under bright daylight. His posture suggests deep focus, while the surrounding crowd moves with casual energy.

LONG PROMPT:
Urban daylight ambience—gentle splashing of water mist—soft rustling leaves—distant chatter and laughter—low hum of footsteps on pavement—subtle piano chords—warm sun-drenched reverb—wind brushing past—metallic clink of a water bottle—faint organ pipe resonance—pedestrian footsteps fading into background—deep bass throb of distant traffic—layered textures of stone, metal, and greenery—spatial depth with foreground piano focus—rising airy haze—balanced warmth with subtle urban grit.
