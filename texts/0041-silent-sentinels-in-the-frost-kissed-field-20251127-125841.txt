TITLE: Silent Sentinels in the Frost-Kissed Field
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251127-125841

ANALYSIS:
Rows of rusted metal posts rise from a muted green meadow, scattered with dark patches of earth. Bare trees and shrubs frame the scene, suggesting a late autumn or winter setting with frost or dew on the grass. The orderly yet fragmented arrangement of posts hints at a forgotten or memorial installation.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a slow, ambient soundscape with a rhythmic drip of moisture on frozen grass, distant wind rustling skeletal branches, and faint metallic whispers from the posts as if echoing a long-forgotten silence — all layered with a hollow, echoing spatial depth that pulls the listener into a quiet, cold, memory-laden space.
