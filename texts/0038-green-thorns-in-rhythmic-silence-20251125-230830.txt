TITLE: Green Thorns in Rhythmic Silence
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251125-230830

ANALYSIS:
A dense cluster of green, ribbed cactus stems rises vertically, each adorned with sharp, evenly spaced spines. The stems vary in thickness and height, creating a textured, layered visual field with soft natural lighting enhancing their vibrant green hue. Depth is suggested by gradual blurring in the background, emphasizing the foreground’s sharp, geometric detail.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a meditative, spatial soundscape of subtle, rhythmic wind brushing against sharp, metallic textures—like distant, echoing clicks and whispers—layered with low-frequency hums that pulse gently, evoking a quiet, enclosed desert garden.
