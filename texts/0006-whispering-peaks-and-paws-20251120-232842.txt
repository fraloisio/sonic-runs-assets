ANALYSIS:
A small, fluffy dog stands alert on a weathered wooden bench overlooking a deep turquoise lake nestled between steep, forested cliffs. The surrounding mountains rise dramatically, covered in evergreens and patches of grass, under a bright, clear sky. The scene is tranquil and expansive, with no visible humans.

LONG PROMPT:
Alpine morning ambience—soft breeze rustles pine needles—distant water droplets splash gently—wooden bench creaks with subtle weight—birdsong trills in layered intervals—crystal-clear lake whispers against stone—high cliffs echo low rumbling wind—muffled footsteps on mossy ground—warm sun glints off wet rock—deep resonance of distant thunder rumbling below—microscopic crickets chirp beneath—high-pitched dog’s breaths steady—space vast and reverent—tones crisp, airy, and cool—texture rich, natural, and immersive—rhythm slow, peaceful, and undulating—depth expansive with layered environmental tones—spatial balance: foreground, midground, and distant peaks clearly defined.
